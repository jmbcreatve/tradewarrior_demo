## 2025-12-05
- Tape/Data: dumps/hl_mainnet_btcusdt_1m_60d.csv
- Config/Preset: Baseline_Mainnet_A (stub)
- Trades: 238
- Win Rate: 40.8%
- Final Equity: 7627.89
- Max Drawdown: 25.94%
- Notes: Stub lost materially on this 60d mainnet tape; sizable drawdown (~26%) suggests current sizing/policy performs poorly here.
